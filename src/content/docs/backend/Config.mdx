This module defines the `TableConfig` class and its associated configurations for managing database tables, 
their Pydantic models, foreign key relationships, and additional processing options.

#### The `TableConfig` class provides a structured way to configure table-specific metadata, such as:
- SQLAlchemy model mappings.
- Pydantic validation models.
- Foreign key relationships and their adjusted column names.
- Fields to exclude during result processing.
